          For some reason, I always struggle to produce quality work in office environments. It doesn't matter if they're open or closed.

          However, I do appreciate offices for the snacks and socializing opportunities they provide.

          Two things I know I love for sure:

          Hiking and backpacking. I can get up at 04.00 a.m. to hike, and I get up excited.

          Coding. I can prioritize coding over everythingâ€”even dismiss marketing. 

          You?

          There are two things that I absolutely love:

          1) Hiking and backpacking. I am willing to wake up at 4:00 a.m. just to hit the trails, and I feel an overwhelming sense of excitement.

          2) Coding. I prioritize coding above everything else, even marketing.

          How about you? What are your passions?
